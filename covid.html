        <p>We are still hoping to go ahead with the wedding and guest list as planned for June 2021. However we are unsure of what the restrictions on social gatherings may be. Therefore we would recomend booking accommodation with a good cancellation policy. </p> 
        
        <br>
        
        <p>If the wedding is unable to go ahead as we have arranged and you are still able / intending to come to the area please know that we will make every effort to celebrate with you in some form.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>We would ask everyone to RSVP by the end of March 2021 to help with our planning. However we totally understand that arranging to travel and join a large gathering during these uncertain times may not be viable for everyone. We have therefore added an optional box on the <a href='rsvp.html'>RSVP form</a> which you can use to share any information on your plans or situation if you are still unsure. </p>
